## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Your operating system and version
- Application version

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed feature
- Use cases and examples
- Any relevant mockups or designs

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the development setup** in the README
3. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits
4. **Add tests** if applicable
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Ensure CI passes** before submitting
7. **Create a pull request** with a clear description

### Development Process

#### Setting up the Development Environment

1. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ip-chat.git
   cd ip-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

#### Code Style

- **Frontend (TypeScript/SolidJS)**:
  - Use TypeScript strict mode
  - Follow the existing code style
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

- **Backend (Rust)**:
  - Follow Rust conventions (`cargo fmt`)
  - Use `cargo clippy` to catch common issues
  - Add documentation comments for public APIs
  - Write tests for new functionality

#### Testing

- **Frontend**: No specific testing framework currently, but manual testing is required
- **Backend**: Use `cargo test` to run Rust tests
- **Integration**: Test the full application on different platforms when possible

#### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add dark mode toggle to settings panel
fix: resolve peer discovery timeout issues
docs: update installation instructions for Linux
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Development Guidelines

#### Adding New Features

1. **Discuss first**: For major features, open an issue to discuss the approach
2. **Keep it simple**: Follow the KISS principle
3. **Consider all platforms**: Ensure features work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify functionality across different network configurations

#### Code Organization

- **Frontend components**: Place in `src/components/`
- **State management**: Use the existing stores in `src/stores/`
- **Rust modules**: Organize by functionality in `src-tauri/src/`
- **Types**: Keep TypeScript types in `src/types/`

#### Performance Considerations

- **Network efficiency**: Minimize network traffic and bandwidth usage
- **Memory usage**: Be mindful of memory consumption, especially for file transfers
- **UI responsiveness**: Keep the UI responsive during long operations
- **Battery life**: Consider power consumption on laptops
